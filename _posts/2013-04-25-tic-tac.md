### Hopefully,

A github button will show up suggesting you watch my tic tac repo. Success!

So, I made a little field that auto-generated when I ran

    rake post title="Tic Tac"

This field I called repo. Basically when I populate that field with a repo name jekyll will know to create a little gitHub button at the bottom of this post facilitating following.

Maybe something for the next uploaded version would be to somehow utilize the description field in a clever way. Such as in the tag, category, or blog page. I'll think about it.
