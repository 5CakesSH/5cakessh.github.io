## Basically,
I can use it to automate a bunch of boring tasks I would do anyways when creating a post or something repetitive of that nature.

Another thing to keep in mind is that apparently posts will not get published unless there is a category tag assigned? I believe this is the case? Nope, totally wrong, forget that last thought.

What happened was that I included some html comment material in the markup header post file which apparently confused old-man jekyll.
