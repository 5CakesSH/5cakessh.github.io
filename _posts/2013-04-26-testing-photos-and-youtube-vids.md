### Am I ready?
Looks like I have this whole static site business down pat, sort of.
But, I like to take photos and show them off.
The plan is to host them elsewhere, but every now and then I'd like to include one in a post directly. And youtube videos...

Here is a youtube video?  

<object class="video"
        type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
        data="http://www.youtube.com/v/LjqtHzmIG6s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"
		width="560" height="315">
    <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LjqtHzmIG6s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" />
    <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
</object>

<br />
Success!


And now a photo...

<img id="aboutPhoto" src="/assets/images/2013-04-26-testing-photos-and-youtube-vids/test.jpg"/>

Adorable at any window size!
